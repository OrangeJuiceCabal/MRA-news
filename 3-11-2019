It is the creation of the first press network that represents the will of the people in the MRA.

We are proud to announce the opening of the first apartment flats of our nation. soon, we will create a city in honour of OrangeJuiceCabal, our valiant leader. Let us look back to when he bravely constructed the Vladimir Lenin Ironworks on the coast, when he unearthed the S.S. King Zog, and when he discovered a fortune of 5 diamonds, 31 gold bars, and 32 iron bars, all of which was for the benefit of the public. Construction is continueing rapidly, and the flats are expected to be finished by 3-11-19.   After tommorow, he will announce the sovereignty of the Maoist Republic of Albania for all in the General Server to hear.

Economy:

In addition to OrangeJuiceCabal's gracious donation to the Department of Treasury, the dark oak lumber sector is booming. unfortunately, however, the MRA will soon deplete its light oak reserves, and will require international trade to resolve. It is unknown when the MRA will open a port for such trade.

Politics:

The boundries of the MRA have been determined, and will be released publicly soon. OrangeJuiceCabal has expressed his desire to construct artificial islands to the East in an effort to regulate travel for the benefit of our nation. OrangeJuiceCabal is making an effort to represent us as his ambassador, but no other states have responded to allow him.
